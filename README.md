# VonNeumannArchitecture

This repository contains a basic implementation of the Von Neumann architecture written in C. This is an educational project meant to illustrate the fundamental principles of this computer architecture.

# Description
VonNeumannSimulator is a simplified model of a CPU, showcasing memory, a program counter, and an accumulator. The project lets you load a program into the simulated machine's memory and execute it, instruction by instruction.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
To build and run this project, you will need a C compiler. This project was developed using GCC, but any standard-compliant C compiler should work.

# Building
To build the project, navigate to the directory containing von_neumann_simulator.c (or whatever the main .c file is named), and run the following command:

gcc -o simulator von_neumann_simulator.c

This will produce an executable named simulator.

# Running
To run the simulator, use the following command:

./simulator


# Future Enhancements
This is a simple and basic implementation meant for educational purposes. Future enhancements could include adding more instructions, support for input and output, or even simulating devices like disks or network adapters.
