# VonNeumannArchitecture

This repository contains a basic implementation of the Von Neumann architecture written in C. Inspired by the groundbreaking work of John von Neumann, this educational project aims to illustrate the fundamental principles of this pivotal computer architecture.

John von Neumann's contributions have shaped the field of computer science as we know it today, and his architectural design forms the foundation of most modern computers. By exploring this simulator, we hope to provide insight into his brilliant work and inspire future computer scientists just as von Neumann has inspired us.

# Description
VonNeumannSimulator is a simplified model of a CPU, showcasing memory, a program counter, and an accumulator. The project lets you load a program into the simulated machine's memory and execute it, instruction by instruction.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
To build and run this project, you will need a C compiler. This project was developed using GCC, but any standard-compliant C compiler should work.

# Building
To build the project, navigate to the directory containing von_neumann_simulator.c (or whatever the main .c file is named), and run the following command:
```bash
gcc -o simulator von_neumann_simulator.c
```

This will produce an executable named simulator.

# Running
To run the simulator, use the following command:
```bach
./simulator
```

# Future Enhancements
This is a simple and basic implementation meant for educational purposes. Future enhancements could include adding more instructions, support for input and output, or even simulating devices like disks or network adapters.
